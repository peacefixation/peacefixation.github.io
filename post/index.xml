      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been making the transition from Java to Go and React at the company I work for. Over the last year or so most of our new web applications consist of a Go backend and React front end. This has been a pleasant experience for the most part, but there&amp;rsquo;s a lot to learn so I decided to write a bunch of Go programs on the side to explore the language.</description>

      <title>Attempted Vortex: a DJ mix</title>

      <description>I put together another mix. This one is a way of replicating some feelings of when I saw John Digweed play a monster 5hr set back in 2002. It was the best thing I ever heard. He lays down a groove and sits you in it and never lets up. Hour after hour of relentless, mesmerising tunes. A vortex that you can&amp;rsquo;t escape. It was wonderful and I wish I could hear it again.</description>

      <description>In the first few weeks of pandemic isolation I setup Ableton again and had some fun mixing tunes. This is one I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to get out for a long time: big, fat progressive-house, heavy groove, shiny on the top, a bit silly in places and straight from my heart.

      <title>Firefox Extension: Github Gists</title>

      <description>I store snippets of code with Github Gists to remind myself how to do things that I don&amp;rsquo;t do regularly enough to remember off hand. At first it was only a few, but my list is growing and as it grows it becomes harder to find the one I want. I&amp;rsquo;ve made myself a little Firefox extension to list all my Gists with a search field so I can quickly locate them.</description>

      <title>Clean SQL embedded in source files with Vim</title>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a task I perform regularly and it&amp;rsquo;s always a 2 step process. One of the programs I maintain queries the database and the SQL is a long series of concatenated strings in a Java source file. I copy the query into a text editor and then remove all the quotes and plus characters so I can modify and test it on the database. Ideally SQL would be kept in an SQL file and it would be easier to work with, but in this case I don&amp;rsquo;t have the liberty of making that modification.</description>

      <description>I mixed some tunes a while ago and I&amp;rsquo;m still quite fond of the result. I made it with Ableton software and it captures a sound that I&amp;rsquo;ve been working towards over the years; techno, a little wonky, melodic, soaring in places, abrasive, with a steady, heavy groove and a few frilly bits.

      <title>Add an offset to a list of numbers with Vim</title>

      <description>Today I was given a task to extract customer account IDs from a log file. grep came to the rescue, however I was then required to add a fixed offset to each account ID so I could build an SQL query with an IN clause. I could have managed this by piping the output of grep to awk or bc, but I thought I would flex my vim muscle in this case.</description>

      <title>Asterisk syntax highlighting extension for Visual Studio Code</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve started using Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s new Visual Studio Code text editor at work and it&amp;rsquo;s pretty neat. I like it more than the Brackets editor that I was using before. It&amp;rsquo;s similar, but more polished and has some excellent features like an integrated terminal and a debugger. As you might expect there is a comprehensive extension repository but once again there was no syntax highlighter for Asterisk dialplan code so I took it upon myself to fill the void and wrote one.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for some more Haskell. I&amp;rsquo;m going to work through chapter 2 of Exercises for Programmers: 57 Challenges to Develop Your Coding Skills and see what happens.
Saying Hello  Create a program that prompts for your name and prints a greeting using your name.
Constraints: Keep the input, string concatenation, and output separate.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading about functional programming lately, and I want to learn a new language to try it out properly. I picked Haskell for a few reasons. First, it&amp;rsquo;s touted as a pure functional language, and that appeals to me because I want to learn functional programming in particular, and not have the concepts blurred by a hybrid language. Second, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of good online resources that I can learn from.</description>

      <title>Asterisk syntax highlighting extension for Brackets</title>
      <link>https://peacefixation.github.io/2016/03/asterisk-syntax-highlighting-extension-for-brackets/</link>

      <description>I recently started using the Brackets text editor. Brackets is a powerful open source text editor in much the same vein as Sublime with lots of nice programming features and support for extensions. Some of the files that I edit are Asterisk configuration files. Asterisk is a VoIP server and these are the files that tell it how to route VoIP calls. They have their own special syntax and Brackets didn&amp;rsquo;t include a syntax highlighter by default, so I thought I might make one.</description>
