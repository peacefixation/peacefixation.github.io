I made a DJ mix a while ago that I'm still quite fond of. I put it together using Ableton software and it captures a sound that I used to play around with a lot on my turntables; techno, a little leftfield, a bit wonky, melodic, abrasive, with a steady, heavy groove and a few really frilly bits. Listening to it now sure takes me back!

I'll post it here for posterity. :)
