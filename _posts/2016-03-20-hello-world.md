This is the first post on my new blog, a place for me to document my programming adventures. I'm a Java developer by trade, and work with Asterisk VoIP server, Linux and various other technologies. In my spare time I like to explore new things;  lately I'm learning Haskell and puddling around with D3.js, and it helps me to consolidate my knowledge by writing about what I learn, so I'm going to do that here and perhaps you might find something of interest. Thanks for stopping by.
