<p>These are some websites that I personally enjoy. You might find something that interests you. They're mostly related to programming, mostly.</p>

{% assign sorted_links = site.data.links | sort:"name" %}

{% for link in sorted_links %}

    <a href="{{link.url}}">
        <h4>{{link.name}}</h4>
    </a>
    <p>{{link.description}}</p>

{% endfor %}
