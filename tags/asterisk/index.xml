      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve started using Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s new Visual Studio Code text editor at work and it&amp;rsquo;s pretty neat. I like it more than the Brackets editor that I was using before. It&amp;rsquo;s similar, but more polished and has some excellent features like an integrated terminal and a debugger. As you might expect there is a comprehensive extension repository but once again there was no syntax highlighter for Asterisk dialplan code so I took it upon myself to fill the void and wrote one.</description>

      <description>I recently started using the Brackets text editor. Brackets is a powerful open source text editor in much the same vein as Sublime with lots of nice programming features and support for extensions. Some of the files that I edit are Asterisk configuration files. Asterisk is a VoIP server and these are the files that tell it how to route VoIP calls. They have their own special syntax and Brackets didn&amp;rsquo;t include a syntax highlighter by default, so I thought I might make one.</description>
